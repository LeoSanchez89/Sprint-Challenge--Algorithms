#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
Because it is using a single loop and the time increases linearly depending on n

b) O(n^2)
Because it is using nested loops, one linear time depending on another linear time gives us O(n^2)

c) O(n)
Because it is calling itself n times until it reaches its base case, it is a linear time

## Exercise II
